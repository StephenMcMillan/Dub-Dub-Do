# Dub Dub Do - A sample TODO List Application in SwiftUI
> Updated for Xcode 11.5

This is a basic app that lets you create a list of todos, mark them as important or complete and then delete them. Simple.

This project was made for fun to try out Swift UI and see how it interacts with other layers of the application now that we don't have view controllers. With that in mind, this is by no means the correct way to do things in SwiftUI (I'm only open sourcing at the request of a few folks on Twitter). In fact it's probably far from that given that this technology is so new. We're all still learning. This project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the ideas put accross in WWDC videos and in the documentation.
